        <h1>What is Cyber Secruity And How to <br>Be Secure On The Internet?</h1>
        <hr style="width: 76%; height: 2px; background-color: #b4befe; border: none;">
        <p>Cyber security is the practice of protecting your digital assets from unauthorized access, use, or damage. It
            involves using various tools, techniques, and strategies to prevent cyberattacks and minimize their impact.
            The internet is a great resource for learning, entertainment, and communication. But it also exposes you to
            various risks and threats. Hackers, scammers, and cybercriminals can try to steal your personal information,
            infect your devices with malware, or compromise your accounts. They can also use the internet to spread
            misinformation, propaganda, or hate speech. <br><br><span style="color: #ed8796; font-weight: 600;">To be
                secure on the internet, you need to follow some basic guidelines and best practices. Here are some of
                them: </span></p>
        <div class="ol-d">
            <ol>
                <li>Use strong and unique passwords for your online accounts. Change them regularly and don’t share them
                    with anyone.</li>
                <li>Use a password manager to store and manage your passwords securely.</li>
                <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your accounts whenever possible. This adds an extra layer
                    of security by requiring a code or a device to log in.</li>
                <li>Use a reputable antivirus software and keep it updated. Scan your devices regularly for malware and
                    viruses.</li>
                <li>Avoid clicking on suspicious links or opening attachments from unknown sources. They could contain
                    malware or phishing attempts.</li>
                <li>Be careful about what you share online. Don’t post sensitive or personal information that could be
                    used against you or to impersonate you.</li>
                <li>Be aware of the signs of phishing and social engineering. These are techniques used by
                    cybercriminals to trick you into giving up your information or access to your accounts.</li>
                <li>Use a VPN (virtual private network) to encrypt your internet traffic and hide your online activity
                    from prying eyes.</li>
                <li>Use secure and trusted websites and apps. Look for the padlock icon and the HTTPS protocol in the
                    address bar.</li>
                <li>Educate yourself about the latest cyber threats and trends. Stay informed and alert.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p style="color: #91d7e3; font-weight: 700;">Cyber security is not only a technical issue but also a human one.
            You need to be responsible and vigilant when using the internet. You also need to respect the rights and
            privacy of others online. By following these tips, you can enjoy the benefits of the internet while staying
            safe and secure.</p>
